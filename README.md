# AI Bias Detection and Mitigation
This is a project for testing AI bias detection and mitigation methods.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required for dependency management:

- **Poetry** - To avoid mess with dependencies we use Poetry. A well known configuration management tool for Python. If you know Maven or NPM, you will love it.

- **Miniconda** - A tiny little tool to have separate Python environments on your machine. You will love it, if you ever have tried to work on multiple Python projects within the same Python installation.

## Installation

Create a new Conda environment:
``` bash
conda create -n <YOUR_ENV_NAME> python=3.10
conda activate <YOUR_ENV_NAME>
```

Install dependencies:
``` bash
poetry install
```

Now you are ready to use the notebooks.
